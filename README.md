# Tank-Game
An attempt at recreating the functionality of Wii Tanks as a top-down 2D game written in Java (keyword attempt)

## Current Features:
- Movement
- Shooting shells with the left mouse button
- Shells ricochet off walls once before exploding
- Player dies if a shell hits them
- Pretty animations (most important obviously)
